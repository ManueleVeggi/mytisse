A1;A;1;It was very interesting to freely be able to guess what the artwork looks like without knowing but basing ourselves on the faint traces shown in the scan. I think that it allowed me to reflect more on my approach to artworks and on my fruition of them, and it would certainly be interesting to replicate the experiment on other works of art!! ;3;5;5;5;2;Palette A;I associate them to spring and more vibrant emotions, and I have chosen the palette according to what I first saw in the scanned image ;1;1;1;4;4;3;2;3;5;Yes. I think it helped me to approach art in a new different way, a way I had never thought of before. I'll probably attend exhibitions and visit museums with a different mindset from now on!! ;Yes;Yes;Yes, in high school;1;1;1;5;5;1;5;4;Humane life experiences;1;1;5;3;1;5;4;
A4;A;4;"It was very interesting notice how the canvas appear with this kind of digitalization, analyzing the different layers of modifications made during the creation. 
I was surprised to see the colored version and the changes that it has. I enjoyed the experience of searching the figures and choosing colors.";1;3;3;3;2;Palette A;I choose it because it made me remember better the style of Matisse. It’s an happy and vibrant color palette that I personally prefer instead of the grey one that shares with me emotion of sadness and fear.;2;3;4;3;2;4;1;3;5;It helped me to fill the curiosity that this exercise arised. ;Yes;Yes;Yes, at university;1;1;1;3;4;1;3;3;Joy of life;1;1;2;4;2;4;4;
A3;A;3;Curiosity ;4;4;5;4;3;Palette A;Some of the colors in the palette remember me the colours of ancient curtains m;1;1;1;2;3;2;1;3;4;No;Yes;Yes;No;2;1;1;1;2;2;2;1;Moments of peace;1;1;3;3;1;2;2;
A2;A;2;We attempted to recognize the shapes painted in this work by Matisse. The first interesting thing I observed is the fact that we had to choose a palette. I had the feeling that while I was looking for shapes, the use of some colours somehow led me to imagine further figures. In addition, I noted that the central part of the work was much less clear than the rest of the painting;1;2;4;5;3;Palette A;I had the feeling it would have been more useful to recognize human shapes. ;2;2;4;1;1;5;1;1;4;Yes, it helped me to realize that my artistic perception is strongly influenced by the artistic genres I studied the most.;Yes;Yes;Yes, in high school;1;1;1;5;3;1;2;3;Sunbathing;1;1;2;2;1;2;5;
B3;B;3;genesis of the artwork, different palette used between the original draft and the final painting ;2;2;5;5;4;Palette B;I chose it because they seemed more adequate to represent the colours of the painting. recalls me discomfort, totally different from previous paintings that had bathers as main subject  ;3;2;2;1;1;4;1;1;5;no;Yes;Yes;Yes, at university;1;1;1;3;3;1;4;2;bathers - a mixture of all Matisse's compositions;1;1;3;5;1;4;1;
B2;B;2;I thought i could easily manage to recognize the schema, yet this was not the case, and I was very surprised when the tutor slowed us the actual painting. ;2;2;3;4;1;Palette B;I find the colors of this palette more harmonized and consistent together;3;3;1;2;5;2;1;4;4;Yes. It's challenging trying to understand the thoughts that might bring an artist to produce such a painting ;Yes;Yes;No;3;4;3;2;3;4;5;2;Humans life;3;2;3;2;3;4;1;
B1;B;1;The human figures in the image were not clearly defined and it was not easy to understand the boundaries between the female figures and the nature elements, such as the plant on the left of the painting, and the background color. More in detail, meanwhile I was trying to highlight the figures, I repeatedly changed my mind about what I was seeing.  In addition to that, since I did not know the painting, I had nothing of specific in mind to look for in the painting. ;4;2;3;1;5;Palette A;The colours were more shining and clearly differentiable the one from the others. In addition to that, because of the title, I imagined a colourful naturalistic image, for which strong summer colours seemed to be a better choice ;2;4;5;2;1;4;5;2;4;It surely helped me in order to better understand the nature of the painting and, in addition to that, it was a very interesting starting point to reflect on the feelings of a man who lived in a time of great suffering and changes, which is a part of the recent history, without directly depicting war and destruction but choosing to reinterpret an apparently peaceful subject.;Yes;Yes;Yes, in high school;1;1;2;4;4;2;5;3;A summer afternoon by a river;2;3;3;4;2;4;3;
C2;C;2;personally I found it a very interesting and helpful experience. as it was quite eye opening and prospective changing as it gave me the time to actual 1) try to search for human figures and what I perceive as such, 2) my own take onto colors. alongside this the explanation and story behind the painting is very very interesting! ;2;4;4;4;4;Palette A;personally as the title that I was told was “soldiers on the river”, I perceived an angrier and more of a denounce tone and I wished to use more “aggressive” colors. but at the same time I felt like they were also colors aligned with our views of life and hence as I was asked to take into account the human beings (and not only, I felt these colors more fitting) l.;4;1;3;1;3;4;1;1;4;I think it did somehow. I think that it has helped me with questioning my own perception of color and of different ideas. it certainly has has me question my own idea of art and color.;Yes;Yes;Yes, in high school;5;2;1;4;4;1;1;1;the island of pleasures;2;3;5;5;1;3;2;
C4;C;4;"The difference of color with the most stereotypical Matisse. 
The fact that some figures seems very different";2;3;5;4;1;Palette A;I used the red for the figure I considered being the soldier on the right side, while I've noticed some female figures that even if I wasn't expecting them they seemed pretty evident to me;1;1;2;4;2;2;4;1;5;Partially. It helped me in developing e sense of care for art and overcoming stereotypes about styles and colours associated with an author.;Yes;Yes;Yes, at university;2;1;2;3;1;1;3;1;Bathers at the river;1;1;4;3;1;3;1;
C1;C;1;I think there should be more quiet place.;3;3;3;3;3;Palette B;Personally i like palette b because for this context i could make sense of it more;2;3;4;2;1;4;2;2;5;Yes always looking at paintings of these famous artists make me thinking. Thinking in their context of their paintings.  And thinking in terms of painting help me to understand the history attached to it.;Yes;Yes;Yes, in other contexts;3;4;4;2;2;2;2;2;Love affair in the middle of neverland;3;2;2;4;2;2;2;
C3;C;3;It’s very interesting to listen to you inner feeling for colouring given painting.;2;4;4;4;4;Palette A;I have seen that there are more dark areas in this painting than light ones. That’s why I’ve chosen a palette with only one light colour.;2;1;4;5;3;4;2;"1;5";5;No;Yes;Yes;No;1;2;2;4;3;2;2;"3;5";Paradise;2;1;"2;4";2;1;3;3;
A7;A;7;The most important aspect was the fact that it's difficult to recognize the elements of the painting without having a perception of the colors;2;3;3;1;"1.2";Palette A;The colors are more vibrant and cheerful (i associate them with joy and positivity);3;1;3;1;1;4;1;1;4;no;Yes;Yes;Yes, in high school;1;1;1;3;3;1;4;2;sex;1;1;4;4;1;1;3;
A8;A;8;I used different colors trying to highlight the figures hidden in a darkened painting;3;3;5;5;1;Palette A;It’s more contrasted and vibrant so that I use it to highlight the main figures in the painting;1;1;3;1;3;3;1;1;5;I don’t agree;Yes;Yes;No;3;2;1;1;2;1;1;1;Paradise Lost;1;1;2;4;2;1;1;
A5;A;5;For me it comes natural to immediate associate colors to images. In this case the shade of grey which suggested an overall composition guided me in the choise of colors, but most of all personal taste influenced my choice. It was interesting to find out how the original image was completely different frlm the one I imagined. In particular the inclination of figures brought me to think of sad figures and their orientation converged for me to a left point that was not present in the painting;2;3;3;3;2;Palette A;It was more related to the object I imagined behind the figures ;1;1;3;2;1;5;2;3;4;It could be true for the painter, as a spectator I find it very sad and with colors which shades that I find annoying overall;Yes;Yes;Yes, in high school;3;2;2;1;1;2;3;1;A day in the park;2;1;3;4;2;2;4;
A6;A;6;The experience was very enlightening as to how imagination can travel when looking at a scan without colors or context. As the time progressed i kept having mixed thoughts about the style of the painting and alternative uses of color. ;3;4;5;5;2;Palette A;When i first looked at the painting a specific shade came to mind and I chose the palette with that color. I associated it more with a sense of mystery.;1;1;3;2;2;4;1;2;5;It was helpful - also through the use of this questionnaire- to put down the feelings that this painting gives me, because I often do not consciously think about that when I look at pieces of art. The fact that it was rejected by the commissioner, but then continued by Matisse and now we have this beautiful artwork, filled me with hope and made me a bit emotional. It is inspiring, thought provoking and admirable the way a painting of a casual, carefree  activity such as bathing by a river, brought me a sense of sadness and fear considering the style of the painting but especially the context of the artwork.;Yes;Yes;No;2;1;2;3;2;1;3;3;Lovers in ecstasy;1;1;2;4;3;1;2;
B5;B;5;The freedom of the experience and the possibility of creating your own personal interpretation was the most important and effective aspect in my opinion. It was an act of self-reflection in some way. ;3;5;5;4;5;Palette B;These colors are less aggressive to the eye and more calming. I also have a stronger preference for pastels. ;3;2;4;2;1;3;1;2;4;I agree since the painting, once contextualized, gives a great insight in the understanding of a creative process and how it is affected by one's surroundings'. It helped me because it gave me food for thought. ;Yes;Yes;Yes, in high school;2;2;4;3;3;2;4;1;Complicity ;1;1;2;3;2;2;4;
B6;B;6;I was asked to colorize a painting by Matisse with very unclear shapes, given only the name of it as a context, and to choose between two colors palettes to use for it. I started looking for human shapes and then for environmental shapes. The fact that I knew what the subject was (naked bodies by a river) helped me to understand what to look for ;1;4;3;2;5;Palette B;Knowing a bit about post-Impressionism, early avantguarde, and the historic period, plus the subject of the painting, I instinctively went with it as it resembles more serious and deep emotions;2;1;3;4;2;4;4;3;4;Yes, but maybe more than looking at it is the whole activity that helped me relax;Yes;Yes;Yes, at university;3;4;4;2;2;2;3;1;Feast of the bathers;3;4;3;3;3;4;2;
B7;B;7;"I'm not good at drawing, but I thought, until today, I have a good imagination. The fact that the art work was not as I imagined does not mean my imagination is bad, but anyway I felt surprised and quite ""guilty"" in the end. ";4;3;1;1;1;Palette A;"I associated the title of the art work to a joy feeling I guess. Moreover, I thought about ""La Danza"" concerning the painter's style and its vivid colors.";1;1;3;4;1;4;3;4;5;Yes, I understood the real vibe of the artwork ;Yes;Yes;Yes, at university;2;3;4;3;1;4;2;4;Precarious freedom;5;2;4;2;4;3;1;
C5;C;5;I learned about new techniques that allow a deeper study of a painting;"4.5";3;2;1;4;Palette A;The colours were brighter ad seemed more clear to me in order to properly distinguish the objects;2;3;3;4;3;5;3;"2;4";4;Helped me learn more about a famous painter and how social context can impact an artwork ;Yes;Yes;Yes, in high school;"3;4";1;2;4;4;3;3;2;The joy of living;1;1;4;5;"3;4";4;4;
C6;C;6;The aspect that I considered the most important is that the artistic research and tools that are being developed could really help and deepen our understanding of the artistic world in every aspect. From conserving to understand better the processes and the different moments of the life of an artistic work;2;3;4;1;5;Palette A;I couldn't say a precise reason, but if i have to guess it's because at the time in my head it was the appropriate choice, but it was unconscious;1;2;1;"1;5";3;"2;5";2;3;5;It is very important to be aware of the art conservation and research process, also in order to prevent the loss or such artistic works;Yes;Yes;Yes, in high school;1;1;1;3;4;1;2;2;Bathing lovers;1;1;3;5;1;4;3;
C8;C;8;The experience makes you fill in a painting or simply draw the outlines of the figures based on the preconceptions that one may have after listening to the title or by knowing the author. ;1;1;3;3;3;Palette B;To me they are comfort colours meaning that they mix well together and it is hard to create bad colour combinations with them;1;1;1;5;5;1;1;1;5;I don't think it helped me, but it is a nice painting that leaves you with something that doesn't have to necessarily be something useful, more of a unique way to portray a scene and the beauty that comes with Matisse's artstyle;Yes;Yes;Yes, at university;1;3;1;1;3;1;1;1;The bathers;1;1;5;5;1;1;5;
B8;B;8;We have tried to individuate figures from an xrf scan of a Matisse painting. It was very interesting, knowing a bit about the artist's style and work, to try and imagine what the painting might look like. But personally I also enjoyed coming up with a composition and a color disposition I felt nice and kind of create my own version of the painting. ;3;5;5;4;4;Palette B;"It's more melancholic but also relaxing, I chose it for the light blue color which was more realistic for the water. I didn't feel like working with ""punch in the eye"" colors today.";1;1;2;3;2;4;1;4;5;Yes, I am very stressed and I found a sense of stillness and calm;Yes;Yes;Yes, in high school;5;1;3;1;1;1;1;1;The garden of pleasures/hippies by the river ;1;1;4;5;1;1;5;
B4;B;4;We draw on a scan of a Matisse’s painting trying to identify the main shapes and items populating the work after the selection of one among two different palettes. After this session, it has been explained to us the story underlying the production of the painting while the real work were shown.;4;3;5;1;2;Palette B;I chose this palette because it evokes me a sensation of calm and relax, which i may have associated with the title of the painting;1;1;2;4;2;3;1;4;4;Yes, it gave me the opportunity to reason about the previous experience i made and to compare what i did with the real work;Yes;Yes;Yes, in high school;2;3;2;1;2;1;4;1;Flowing Matisse;1;1;2;3;1;2;2;
C7;C;7;Starting from an RX image of a painting, I had to select and isolate the figures I could see and then color over them. I've been using an app called ibisPaintX and I had two predefined sets of colours, but I could choose only one of them.;2;1;4;5;3;Palette A;I saw since the beginning human figures, the tone of pink in that palette could have been useful for the body parts, moreover there were more brilliant tones.;2;1;3;4;1;5;1;3;5;Yes. It makes me feel the irreversible correlation that humanity has with nature. How this can be reverted in bad situations and how nature should be served and respected by humans.;Yes;Yes;Yes, in high school;2;1;3;4;3;5;4;4;Natural dancing in love;1;2;4;5;4;2;1;
