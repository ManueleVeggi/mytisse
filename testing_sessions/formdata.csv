"2023/06/08 12:44:15 PM EEST","A","5","","For me it comes natural to immediate associate colors to images. In this case the shade of grey which suggested an overall composition guided me in the choise of colors, but most of all personal taste influenced my choice. It was interesting to find out how the original image was completely different frlm the one I imagined. In particular the inclination of figures brought me to think of sad figures and their orientation converged for me to a left point that was not present in the painting","2","3","3","3","2","Palette A","It was more related to the object I imagined behind the figures ","1","1","3","2","1","5","2","3","4","It could be true for the painter, as a spectator I find it very sad and with colors which shades that I find annoying overall","Yes","Yes","Yes, in high school","3","2","2","1","1","2","3","1","A day in the park","2","1","3","4","2","2","4"

The fact that it was rejected by the commissioner, but then continued by Matisse and now we have this beautiful artwork, filled me with hope and made me a bit emotional.
